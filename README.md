# Advent of Code '22

This repository contains my solutions for AoC'22 problems, written in the language that will save us from `cpp`.

## Running the code

The project organisation uses `cargo` as it's package manager.

The `main` script of the module benchmarks and executes the imported functions.

To view the same for any day, just import the module `day<number>` in `main.rs`, and then call the `bench` function on the `part1` or `part2` function of that module.

Run the script by:

```
cargo build && cargo run
```

## Benchmarks

The execution times of all the scripts on my `Intel I7` machine are listed as follows:

| Question | Time        |
| -------- | ----------- |
| 1A       | `251.599us` |
| 1B       | `286.452us` |
| 2A       | `1.22323ms` |
| 2B       | `1.01850ms` |

## Merry Hacking!!
